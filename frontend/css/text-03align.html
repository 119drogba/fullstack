        Original Story (June 30, 2024): The 12th and final episode of the Kaiju No.8 TV anime finished airing on
        Saturday, June 29. A short teaser (below) by TOHO Animation was broadcast right after, confirming that the anime
        will be renewed for another season.

        Adapted from Naoya Matsumoto’s manga of the same name, Kaiju No.8 premiered its first TV anime season in April
        and was available to stream internationally through Crunchyroll and X (formerly Twitter) simultaneously. Season
        two will likely follow suit in the same streaming patterns, although only Crunchyroll has confirmed thus far
        that the show will return to their platform.

        While no further information regarding a release time frame is announced at the time of writing, the new season
        will likely pick up on “The Compatible User Arc” from the manga, where protagonist Kafka Hibino will work
        relentlessly to prove his worth to stay within the Defense Force. The teaser video also reveals a Koki Uchiyama
        as a new voice cast, who will be portraying Gen Narumi, captain of the First Division Defense Force, in the
        upcoming season.
